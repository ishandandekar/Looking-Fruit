:wave: Hello and welcome to the **Looking-Fruit :apple:** code repository. This is a short and simple computer vision project. In this project, I replicate and try to improve the models used to classify images of fruits. You can see the research paper [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321475443_Fruit_recognition_from_images_using_deep_learning). The original code repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset). This is my first independant paper replication project :smile:.

## Introduction

Computer Vision domain has always been my curiosity. I thought paper replication was a great start to then replicate state-of-the-art models like ResNets.
The **objective** of the research paper was to classify images various fruits and vegetables correctly. The researchers made a total of 10 models based and documented there results. The main of this project is to beat and/or achieve the highest score on the test set when compared to their best model.

**Abstract of the paper:**  
In this paper we introduce a new, high-quality, dataset of images
containing fruits. We also present the results of some numerical experiment for training a neural network to detect fruits. We discuss the
reason why we chose to use fruits in this project by proposing a few
applications that could use such classifier.

## Data

The original data for the paper was published and created by the researchers themselves. The dataset contains a total of around 90,000 images of **131** fruits and vegetables. The data is then split into two sets: training and testing sets. This test set contains almost 25% of the total dataset.

For my ease-of-use I uploaded the dataset available on Github to Kaggle, and used this for the project. Check out the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishandandekar/fruitimagedataset) and do try making models yourself!

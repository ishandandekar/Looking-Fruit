# Looking-Fruit

:wave: Hello and welcome to the **:apple: Looking-Fruit** code repository. This is a short and simple computer vision project. In this project, I replicate and try to improve the models used to classify images of fruits. You can see the research paper [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321475443_Fruit_recognition_from_images_using_deep_learning)
